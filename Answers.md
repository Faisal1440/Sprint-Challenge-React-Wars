1. What does it mean to think in react?
React community has provided a direction on how to think in React way and build big , fast and scalable applications.Step 1 − Creating a simple mock service.Step 2 − Break the functionality into smaller components.Step 3 − If possible start by making a simple static version.Step 4 − Identifying the Minimal representation of UI state.Step 5 − Identify where the state should live or located.Finally, Step 6 − Add two way data flow if required.

1. Describe props.
Props are variables passed to it by its parent component. Without props, React Component will stop making sense. A React component is a reusable component which can be used over and over again in the UI, but not always we are going to render the same component with same data. Sometimes we have to change the data or content inside a component. That’s why props are introduced in React

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?
A "side effect" is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed. So basically, anything that results in changes that can be observed when the calculation is completed, beside the return value of the calculation itself, is a side effect.
